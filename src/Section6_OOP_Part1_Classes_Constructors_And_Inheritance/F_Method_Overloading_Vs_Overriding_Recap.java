    // METHOD OVERLOADING - providing two or more methods in a class with same name but with different parameters. (Compile polymorphism)

    // METHOD OVERRIDING - defining a method in a child class that already exists in the parent class with the same signature (same name, same arguments)(Runtime Polymorphism)
    // Only instance methods can be overridden.
