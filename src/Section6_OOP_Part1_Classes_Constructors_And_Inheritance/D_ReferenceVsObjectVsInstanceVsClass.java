    * Let's use the analogy of building a house, to understand classes.
    *
    * A class is basically a blueprint for a house, using the blueprint (plans) we can build as many houses as we like based on those plans.
    *
    * Each house you build (in other words instantiate using the new operator) is an object also known as an instance.
    *
    * Each house you build has an address ( a physical location). In other words if you want to tell someone where you live, you give them your address. This is known as a reference.
    *
    * You can copy that reference as many times as you like but there is still just one house.
    *
    * We can pass references as parameters to constructors and methods.
